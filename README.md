OpenQuake Risk Library (oq-risklib)
-----------------------------------

OpenQuake Risklib is an open source library for seismic risk assessment,
which includes several modules capable of calculating losses and damage
distributions for a scenario earthquake, or for calculating probabilistic
risk from all the possible events that might occur in a region within a
certain time span (that can be estimated through an event-based approach,
or a classical PSHA-based approach). The main outputs of this library are
loss statistics, loss maps, loss curves, damage distributions and collapse
maps.

The GEM Foundation (http://www.globalquakemodel.org/) supports the development
of this library by adding the most common methodologies used by seismic risk
modellers. Comments, suggestions and criticisms from the community are always
very welcome.
