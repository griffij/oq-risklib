Scenario Damage and Consequences Demo
-------------------------------------

The demo consists of two parts: hazard and risk. The hazard and risk
calculations are defined in separate .ini files and were designed to be
run together to form a complete end-to-end demonstration of the workflow.

**Hazard**
Expected runtime: 1 minute  
Outputs: Ground Motion Fields

**Risk**
Expected runtime: 1 minute  
Outputs: Damage Distribution per Asset, Damage Distribution per Taxonomy, Total Damage Distribution, Collapse Map, Consequences per Asset, Consequences per Taxonomy, Total Consequences
